# Covid-19-Time-Series
An exploration of the relationship between new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths caused by Covid-19 using time series techniques such as ARIMA models and the Kalman Filter.

The data used in this project was acquired on Kaggle, the WHO's official website, and from the independent source The Atlantic, collected between January 2020 and March 2022.
The .ipynb file is the original code used to create visualizations of the Covid-19 pandemic data as time series data. The code also includes interesting
predictions of new cases using ARIMA models. I've also experimented with the Kalman Filter to try and achieve a more accurate representation of what deaths 
attributed to Covid-19 really looked like before the spike. The code from the .ipynb file is my own, but this project was completed in collaboration with Jake Snow, Hunter Lybbert, and Jeremy Rawlings.
